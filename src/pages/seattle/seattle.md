# SAC XV May 2019
The Seattle Angel Conference is an investor-led event, connecting Entrepreneurs and new Angel Investors. Startup companies that are expanding rapidly into new markets need outside funding. Angel Investors provide access to high-risk capital for these companies. This conference brings a collection of new and experienced Angel investors into a fund, where each investor puts up $5500, creating a fund, which we expect to be between $100K and $200K.

Companies that apply participate in a company review, which helps provide feedback, strengthening the companies. Over several weeks, the Angel investment committee will review and sort the applying companies. This ongoing review helps strengthen the investment process.

In the end, six companies will get a deep review by the investment committee and will present at the final event. The current date for the Angel Conference Event in May.

Companies wishing to have strong consideration for presenting need to apply before February 29th, 2019. The application process includes purchasing a company application ticket , completing a profile on Gust.com and submitting it to https://gust.com/organizations/seattle-angel-conference.
