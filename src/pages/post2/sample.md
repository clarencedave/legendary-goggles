#SAC XIV - November 14th, 2018
The 14th edition of Seattle Angel Conference is ahead of us, with six competitive companies ready to present 
on stage. As we head into the final event, let’s review the process they've gone through, and of course, who 
are they. At the end of the event, we will have selected the company(s) which will receive the investment 
from the investor fund. 

#THE PROCESS
So many companies have tried but only 6 has made it to the finals. For a series of structured investor meetings
designed to let the group learn angel investing by doing angel investing, from beginning until the end. After
reviewing the company profiles, from 53 applying companies we are now down to 6. They've gone through 
several rounds of pitches and Q&A to identify whether they are investable or not.
 On the companies' side, it's been a big thing for them to prepare and get ready for the pitches and slide decks 
that they need to do. In my observation, it was an interesting thing for each companies as they take the challenge 
to participate, they don't just look for the presentation to be prepared at the right time, but they get that chance 
to provide a complete and concise data, logistics and opportunity while positively addressing all the key ideas.
